Sexy Scaffold
============

This fork by wolas does NOT:
  - create fixtures 
  - create helpers or helper specs.
  - use make_resourceful
  - create xml in controllers or specs

better than rspec_haml_scaffold
- support for model values upon generation

better than make_resourcesful
- creates scaffolded specs for controllers, models and views
- uses sexy migrations for models

notes
when using script/destroy on nested controllers you must destroy the nest like

ruby script/destroy rest_scaffold yoda/bob
