First attempt at making script to create a rails app with serveral components already setup.

= Usage 

  In location where project is to be created:
  'ruby <path_to_rail_cutter>/rail_cutter.rb <project_name>'
  
  comment lines out in the add_customization method to change what components are intalled, command line options will be added at some time.

  
= Which will:
  = create rails app called Automation
  = create git repo
  = install gems (json, fastercsv.... just add more)
  = install haml with sass
  = setup a welcome contoller and index (and remove public/index.html)
  = add a basic layout file (main.haml) to app/views/layouts and update application_controller
  = install jrails
    - download Jquery-UI and sets up js and css files - gets v 1.7.2, want to automate version selection at some point.
    - adds stylesheet_link_tags to layout file
  = install scaffolds - uses my fork of wolas sexy_scaffold which has some additions to be more authlogic friendlys
  = install authlogic
    - create user_sessions model and controller
    - create users model, controller and views with act_as_authentic on the model
    - adds authlogic methods to application_controller such as current_user and before_filter require_login
    - adds authlogic routes (login, register)
