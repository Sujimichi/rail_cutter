First attempt at making script to create a rails app with serveral components already setup.

RailCutter.new_project "Automation"

will:
  = create rails app called Automation
  = create git repo
  = install gems (json, fastercsv.... just add more)
  = install haml with sass
  = setup a welcome contoller and view
  = add a layout file
  = install jrails
    - download Jquery-UI and sets up js and css files - gets v 1.7.2, want to automate version selection at some point.
  = install scaffolds - uses my fork of wolas sexy_scaffold which has some additions to be more authlogic friendlys
  = install authlogic
    - create user_sessions model and controller
    - create users model, controller and views with act_as_authentic on the model
    - adds authlogic methods to application_controller such as current_user and before_filter require_login
    - adds authlogic routes (login, register)

  = and then just because it will scaffold a llama, just for you. - things are still in the creation phase ok.


- Usage

atm this is just a class, I've not made it more user friendly atm
just go to dir you want project to be created in and run
ruby <path_to_rail_cutter/rail_cutter.rb>

comment lines out in the add_customization method to change what components are intalled.
